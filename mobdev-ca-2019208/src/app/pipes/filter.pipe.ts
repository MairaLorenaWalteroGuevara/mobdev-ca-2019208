//  ionic 4+: Search Bar - MÃ³dulos - Filtros   by  Fernando Herrera
// this video is in spanish and also have other video beffore but the first video dont give you a lot of inforamtion. 
// to create the module you have to: 
//1. in your console generate the pipe : ionic g m pipes 
//2. create the folder : ionic g pipe pipes/filter ( or name that you want)
// 3. allow to export the module to other folders, cahnging the pipe.module.ts and adding export the module
// 4. you have to import the module in each page you want to use inside of the module.ts



import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';
import { Quote } from '@angular/compiler';

// It is a module created to run the transform method to filter the information that 
//I am looking for in my seach bar inside of quotes.html


@Pipe({
  name: 'filter'
})
export class FilterPipe implements PipeTransform {

  transform( quotes: any[], text: String): Quote[] {
    
    // I use a lot console.log to print in my console that I am getting the inforamtion that I need
    console.log(quotes);

   //what this method do is taking the input from the search bar (text) 
    // if text does not have information return my normal array with all my quotes, 
    // but if not, this filter takes and return waht match with the input : 
    // so if my array quotes include the input, this return that information from my array. 
    // In this case qoute.qoute allow you to look for the words inside of the quotes and 
    // qoute.aouthor allow you to look for words inside of the  autor or for the author. 


    if (text.length===0){return quotes;}
    text = text.toLocaleLowerCase(); 
    return quotes.filter(quote =>{
        return quote.quote.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(text)
        || quote.author.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(text);
       // console.log(text);
    });
    
  }

}
